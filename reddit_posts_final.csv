At Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, & Wharton, every job you apply for in finance or consulting, your resume will get legitimately looked at. Your resume still has to be impressive (which it should be if you go here, are active on campus, figure out some internships), and you still have to have some knowledge (i.e. Technicals for IB, case studies for MC), but if you have these all you are more or less certain to get an interview (as long as you network with alumni). No school will guarantee you a job, but HYPSMW will get your foot in the door, then it's on you to make it happen. 

Lots of kids go into consulting here, mostly MBB but boutiques/Big 4/other notables like Accenture or OW have a presence. A lesser but still very significant group go into IB. If you're interested, get yourself into relevant clubs (I suggest YSIG, YUDI, Yale Consulting Group, YNI Consulting Group, Tamid, Sube, any other gender/orientation/race/ethnicity specific groups) and learn from older students.",7,Can active or recently graduated students speak to the success of Yale students into major banks in investment banking as well as into consulting at the big firms MBB?

I surprisingly got into Yale, and USC with other safety schools also. USC has always been a dream of mine and I love the work hard/ play hard atmosphere with the weather also. I applied to Yale as another reach school and found out I got in, in early December. While USC has been my dream, Yale seems like an opportunity worth pursuing for me. I’m not quite sure what I want to major in and Yale better caters to that IMO. It seems that Yale somewhat lacks school spirit and the social scene compared to USC but I want to give it a try for at-least one year. If I decide to transfer after a year at Yale, how likely would it be for me to be able to transfer to USC? Or in general, is it difficult to transfer out of Yale into another top university? I think I will love Yale but if not I want to be able to have a back-up option.

12,"What sports, if any, is Yale D1 in?",18,g0olet,yale,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/g0olet/what_sports_if_any_is_yale_d1_in/,"Are you wondering what the sporting/athletic culture is like in general?

Just to set proper expectations off the bat, Yale doesn't have anywhere near the sports atmosphere or environment of a big D1 football or basketball powerhouse like USC or Ohio State or Florida or Duke.

That being said, there is definitely still a lot of fun to be had supporting Yale sports teams. 

Football: I would say most people don't really care other than the Game vs. Harvard every year, which is attended by just about everyone on campus plus tons of alumni.

Basketball: The Yale team has actually been quite good in recent years, finishing at or near the top of the Ivy League. We've gone to March Madness twice in the past 4 years, upsetting Baylor in the first round in 2016, and were set to go dancing again this year until COVID-19 happened.

Hockey: Probably Yale's strongest overall program in the major sports. We won a national championship in 2013 and the team is generally pretty competitive. Going to hockey games at the Whale is a really fun experience, and that's coming from someone who grew up in latitudes where it never snows.

Other sports like tennis, lacrosse, squash, fencing: these are all ""bougie"" sports that I didn't have much experience with before going to Yale, coming from a middle class background, but it's pretty interesting and fun overall to watch some of these competitions and learn more about them, especially if you have friends on those teams. That's another positive of Yale in regards to athletics - the fact that the student community is so small and tight-knit, along with the residential college format, means that you'll likely be friends and classmates and roommates with  varsity athletes on various teams, which might not be the case at big schools with more cliques and fragmented social groups.",14,Recent admit wondering what sports is like!,1586831087

I remember reading somewhere that EWSP gets around 100 applicants per year, so if the original pot is that small then that's good news...

BTW, what Harvard program did you apply to that you got an interview? JW because I'm not aware of any pathways in except regular undergrad and the Extension School, and the undergrad decisions were announced back in March (I applied, lol). I've done a lot of research on the Extension School but it's not really the experience I want.

I was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&#x200B;

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

&#x200B;

Fourth, what are just some general pitfalls people often fall into or things they tend to omit that they should have emphasized more? Or really, just any advice in general, unironically I don't know shit so I'll take any wisdom that comes my way.

While we love to rehash old stereotypes of cut-throat Harvard students, we can't really claim that one is more or less competitive than the other.

I've personally found Yale, and my residential college in particular, to be very tight knit. Unlike colleges in NYC/Boston where people spread out all over on weekends, there's not a whole lot else to do in New Haven, which means campus life takes center stage. This includes a ton of underground performances, suite parties, nearby restaurants, frats or student group events. 

With regards to students, all my peers are certainly driven, but I've never felt that people were ever competing against each other - we are all just striving towards our own goals.

Lastly, I think Yale's campus is simply a lot more beautiful to look at. Harvard and Stanford are nice, but they don't have as many stunningly beautiful places to match say, Sterling library, Branford courtyard, Hillhouse avenue or the Art Gallery.",4,"Hi!

52,Physics at Yale,5,bcwuy7,yale,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/bcwuy7/physics_at_yale/,"I was a Yale Physics Major so I can definitely comment!

The Yale physics program is actually quite strong, and I think it would certainly allow you to get into any top grad program you wanted if you did well. Although I ended up working in data science, all my friends who went to grad school got into really great physics PhD programs (like Harvard and MIT). It is certainly an extremely rewarding major, but especially if you do the intensive major, it’s probably one of the more challenging programs at Yale.

As for Physics 180/181, to be completely candid with you, I didn’t know any Physics major that took that sequence, as that really is for pre-meds and probably not what you’re looking for. My pre-med suite mates took it and it seemed like a basic standard college physics course but certainly not as richly calculus based as you’d want as a major.

So if you know you want to major in Physics and have the high school background (namely Physics C), I’d highly recommend taking Physics 260/261, as it is really the intro sequence designed for Physics majors and presents some really cool topics like GR in an accessible way. The most challenging part of 260/261 may be the math as you really need Math 120 (multivariable calculus) - you can take Math 120 as a corequisite but if you’ve never seen multivariable at all it may be more challenging. (I actually took 260/261 sophomore year after having taken Math 120 freshman year and I felt that this made things relatively easier).

The other option is to take the more engineering focused 200/201 which I know a few physics majors who did and enjoyed, but I’d still recommend 260/261 as it’s really THE intro sequence for anyone who wants to major in physics and has a strong math background.",13,"Hey everyone, I'm currently a prefrosh intending to study physics and was just curious if anyone could share what the physics experience is like at Yale. I'm currently deciding between Yale, Columbia, Duke, and (possibly) Cornell, but slightly favoring Yale at the moment because of the residential college system and UG experience as a whole. Can anyone tell me what it's like to take intro physics courses like 180 and 181, what the science research opportunities are like, how accessible physics faculty are, and if I would have a decent shot at top STEM schools (MIT, Caltech, Stanford) for grad school if I do undergrad at Yale? Thanks!",1555227990
53,Physics at Yale,5,bcwuy7,yale,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/bcwuy7/physics_at_yale/,"Hey I'm not a physics major but am an engineering major at Yale and have plenty of friends who are physics majors here so I can comment.  To reply to your previous comment, if you've taken AP calculus through BC calculus and never any other physics, I would recommend shopping PHYS 200 and PHYS 260 when you get here and seeing which one you like better. Over the years, it seems that 260 is a better-taught course than 200, but the professors recently switched so it may be different. Ultimately, you should take Math 120 (Multivariable calculus) or Math 230 (proof-based multivariable calculus and real analysis) concurrently with your intro course. Math 230 I would only recommend if you have extensive proof-based math background and are really looking to get into the proof side of math along with your physics education. The great thing about Yale is that you have the opportunity to ""shop"" the courses (i.e. PHYS 200 and 260) at the same time up until ~2 weeks into the semester so you can see which one is better for you. I have had friends take the PHYS 180/181, 200/201, and 260/261 intro course sequence and still become physics majors, so it's not going to stop you from becoming a major no matter which sequence you take. However, from experience I think 200/201 or 260/261 are the best to prepare you for future courses in the major. I would take a look at the [Yale physics major required courses] (http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/physics/) or the [helpful page here] (https://physics.yale.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/guide-introductory-physics-course) to see exactly what you should be taking other than the intro courses for the major.

As for your question on research/faculty and graduate school admissions, the good thing is that Yale physics is on the smaller side, so getting research experience is really easy. As an engineering major here, I've worked in two labs and co-authored six papers here during my time due to the ease of working with faculty and the fact that they treat you like graduate students if you put in enough time. The physics major also lets you do research for credit (PHYS 469/470) as first-year and sophomore as pass/fail and (PHYS 471/472) as junior and senior for letter grade, so you can do this during the semester for your major and fulfill requirements that way. For the summer, Yale has a variety of [summer research grants for undergraduates] (https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-science-engineering-research/fellowship-grants) which give you a stipend to live in New Haven and conduct research with a faculty member. They are usually approximately $4300-$4500 per summer, which is more than enough to do research and walk away with a little extra money after the summer ends. Yale has good placement in graduate school admissions because what matters for that is letters of recommendation and research experience, and faculty tend to write very good letters here since research experience is easy to get, and the labs are small enough that the faculty will get to know you very well. One example I would give you is just to go on any Yale faculty's website and look at where the ""former undergraduate students"" have gone on to graduate school, like [Prof. David DeMille's website here] (https://demillegroup.yale.edu/former-undergraduate-students), who has sent most of his former undergraduates to Harvard or Stanford PhD programs (and this is just one example of many).

Course-wise, your intro course sequence (etc. PHYS 260/261) will be accompanied by an intro laboratory course sequence for physics (PHYS 205L/206L). After your first year, you will generally take one semester advanced classical mechanics (PHYS 410), one semester electrodynamics (PHYS 430), one semester thermodynamics/statistical mechanics (PHYS 420), two semesters of quantum mechanics (PHYS 440/441), and advanced physics lab (PHYS 382L). Beyond this, you will be able to take any electives in the undergraduate or graduate school to supplement your education; popular ones include solid-state physics (PHYS 448/449), particle physics (PHYS 442), and other courses in astrophysics and graduate school of physics. Of course, you should also take more math classes such as linear algebra (MATH 222 or 225) and ordinary/partial differential equations (ENAS 194 or MATH 246 and MATH 247). Many physics majors will supplement their major with advanced proof-based math in case they want to go into physics theory graduate school.

I've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from Princeton, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors 

*20 PhD here. I wasn’t in CS but had friends who were (both PhD and masters students). No need to worry about how masters students are treated compared to PhD students. There isn’t a pecking order like you’re describing. That’s just your imposter syndrome whispering doubt in your head. We all have it. Try to tell it to shut the fuck up. 

As for advisor horror stories, that kind of relationship is going to be hit and miss anywhere you go. Do your due diligence when you’re applying to grad school. If you’re invited on campus visits, ask the grad students you meet to lay the cards plainly on the table about the pros and cons of the program, the faculty, and the social life. Grad school is HARD. It’s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows anywhere you go. It’s better to be armed with realistic expectations than a false sense of security. 

As for why Princeton — again, I wasn’t in CS, so I can’t speak to the minutiae of department culture. That being said, I do know that Princeton stands apart from peer institutions (e.g. Harvard and Stanford) in CS that it pays its masters students. **This is huge.** There is so much to be said for the impact financial security (or lack thereof) has on our mental health. Princeton pays its students very well, and as a masters student you’re basically guaranteed to live in campus housing (below market value) while you’re there. I pinched pennies, but I was actually able to save money while in grad school. If you find yourself in a situation where you’re choosing between multiple programs, unless you’re independently wealthy, **whether or not you get paid should be a MAJOR deciding factor.**
 
Cons about Princeton: it’s a sleepy town. The orange bubble is real and can be a real drag at times. As a grad student you’ll always feel second chair to the undergrads. We all know Princeton is primarily and undergraduate institution coming in, but I don’t think it really hit how comparatively under-supported grad students are treated by the administration. At the end of the day, though, it’s still Princeton. Our lot as grad students is still much better than at other schools (which the faculty/admins so persistently remind us whenever we gripe). 

Good luck, OP.",9,"I'm an undergraduate computer science student who'll be applying for master's programs this coming application cycle. Princeton is currently on the list of programs I'm looking at, and I wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts.

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts.

2. Uchicago down because the city of Chicago is on the decline, they manipulate admissions numbers, and students are beginning to realize that college is more than academic rigor.

4. Stanford, MIT, and Caltech will continue to rise due to the shift in higher education towards technology.
5. Duke will continue to rise due to its location in a fast-growing suburb (not in a big city, which is important post-corona), its growing international profile in China and Singapore, and its global health dominance along with JHU.
6. USC, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, and Wash U will stick around because of large endowments.
7. Brown and Dartmouth will continue to do well, but they lack the research component that will be critical in the next few decades.
8. Cornell is on a perpetual decline.

H is a much larger institution, where P has a definite focus on undergrad. P is essentially the reason for its namesake small town, where as H is integrated into Cambridge (and a lesser extent Boston). New Haven isn't explicitly a college town, but it kinda is.

Other aspects: I believe P has a greater sports participation (varsity and club levels) than the other schools, H a greater lean towards grad/academic research (duh, given the sheer quantity of colleges). I know less about Y in that regard. Please don't interpret this as ""Y doesn't do sports or P doesn't do research,"" these all exist at each institution and you're definitely able to seek out whatever you desire (and if it doesn't exist there's room and support to create).

 Certain colleges \(e.g Dartmouth\) are known for being really tight\-kit while others \(e.g Columbia\) supposedly have a weaker sense of campus community. What is the community like at Princeton? Do you know a large percentage of your peers? Do people interact only with small social groups or is there campus\-wide community as well?

I visited Cornell and found it to be sort of massive and impersonal, while I loved Williams and Dartmouth. Where does Princeton fall on this spectrum? I know this is partially an issue of size but I'm particularly curious about the culture.

Deflation has a strong legacy on campus: many to most departments curve only a bit better than deflation-era policy, and students are very aware of it. Maybe there are a few exceptions: the econ department, for instance, curves very aggressively. However, many intro-level classes (Physics, Math) still curve to a B or B+. This is part of what makes Princeton very hard, even compared to other Ivies. However, if you look at the trend, you will see that average GPA has been rising over the years: even though most departments still curve similarly to deflation-era, there is definitely an upward trend in GPAs as departments slowly start to inflate grades again.

Personally, I am actually not that upset about any of this. It's something people groan about a bit, but, as I said, I view it largely as self-repairing over time. Some classes should be curved to a B or B+ (some very large intro classes), but now classes which should curve above that do: most professors have a pretty good idea of what should happen and set their classes to that point.

This is a serious consideration when deciding to attend Princeton: do you want it to be hard to get As? If so, this is a great place.

99,Coronavirus Response,37,fp7jss,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/fp7jss/coronavirus_response/,"R y'all serious? This is SO MUCH MISINFORMATION. I suggest you read the emails that have all of this information instead of blowing it off as ""useless.""

1. They announced that students had to leave by Monday on the previous Wednesday. That was WAY more time than other colleges gave them.
2. Given how fast the situation changed within that same week before leaving, could you blame them for delaying given the fact that Dartmouth sustains the entire local economy of Hanover? Unlike other schools, Dartmouth had other factors to consider because us shutting down had more at stake than just the well-being of students.
3. Are you saying that telling people to leave and come back wouldn't potentially bring the virus to campus/increase its spread/unnecessarily burden a rural community with an older population that relies on ONE hospital to sustain basically all of northern new england? Get over yourself. 
4. I've been refunded in full for housing and meals, including student fees. They said they'd get it done by March 25 if you read the student assembly FAQ (which they did), and added on student fee refunds today. This is just straight up wrong. 

Also, as for the dorm situation, their response wasn't perfect, but not in the ways you expected. They approved all international students to stay on campus EXCEPT those who were already US citizens by MISTAKE. According to OPAL/the FYSEP coordinator, this was unintentional because it was done automatically. 

Additionally, they made channels of communication open through the dean of the college email account, offered additional support through several offices, and have communicated daily with new information and updates. 

They couldn't cancel spring break and isolate everyone on campus because PEOPLE ALREADY STARTED LEAVING. Most people I knew didn't have finals that thursday/friday. I was literally on a bus when Harvard canceled that Tuesday morning, and a ton of others were already off campus by then. No one expected Harvard to cancel, and I don't think any of the peers intended to either until that happened. This sent the higher education world into a meltdown, and Dartmouth had to worry not just about a student body but a local economy too. 

The schools you mentioned (Harvard, Yale, Pton & more) also sent off their students really abruptly without telling htem how they could find housing/accommodations and told them not to come back while they were in the middle of their spring breaks. Most of these schools actually fucked over international and low-income students by providing no information (Harvard, particularly, announced they were cancelling and didn't tell low-income/international students what to do), some even denied international NON-US-CITIZEN students (cough: princeton) from staying, and all just totally screwed people over. 

I don't defend Dartmouth in a lot of things. This is something I will say they did better than most. The only university that I think addressed this better was Cornell; they did everything we had to ask Dartmouth for, but way earlier.

Read your emails next time. They updated people daily, were communicative, and answered questions as soon as those answers were available.",12,"Am I the only one who thinks Dartmouth's coronavirus response was absolutely horrific? 

Timeline:

- Announces that students have 4 days to leave dorms, and will not be able to stay 
- The day after students have to vacate (and tuition is due), announces that students will not be returning
- Prohibits students, even those still in Hanover, from retrieving their belongings for any reason
- Has yet to refund anyone for spring term, and provided zero assistance for students with nowhere to go or money to get there

The fact that they announced that students wouldn't be returning the literal day after evicting everyone makes it incredibly clear that the decision was ready, and they just didn't want students to panic (or to not pay spring tuition). 

Sitting here as a '20, I'll have to cross the country and return to Hanover after June to retrieve my belongings: which I could've taken with me and simply moved on had Dartmouth announced their decision when they made it. 

Unlike almost all of its peer institutions, including Yale and Harvard specifically), Dartmouth has failed to keep dorms open for students who rely on them for housing, and has opted instead to throw hundreds of poor students onto couches, shelters, and the streets with 4 days notice. Their reasoning? To ""fight the spread of coronavirus"": by sending students traveling around the globe after an outbreak instead of isolating on campus. Dartmouth screwed over its students because it wanted to dodge culpability, and its response literally worsened the crisis. 

Absolutely horrible crisis response by Dartmouth on all levels. Good thing they raised so much with the Call to Lead, as it is hard for me to imagine someone from the current classes choosing to donate to Dartmouth after their disastrous mishandling.",1585237799

103,Dartmouth Interview GONE WRONG?!,2,avxdzb,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/avxdzb/dartmouth_interview_gone_wrong/,"As someone who does alumni interviews, I typically get assigned my candidates and then when the interview happens is based on my ability to schedule it. I’ve also only had three students I’ve interviewed ever get in— I’m in a major city with a competitive applicant pool. As an interviewer, I will leave the interview with a sense of whether I liked the kid or not, and can usually tell if they have no shot, but otherwise I don’t really have a sense if they’re likely to get in, because Dartmouth just gets so many competitive applicants.  There was only one kid I’ve interviewed who I knew would 100% make it (legacy, top grades at a top school, spoke a bunch of languages and stuff), and only one applicant who I would have been truly crushed to see not get in (he got in). I know my alumni association tries to interview everyone, but we have a ton of alums in the area so that’s pretty doable. We don’t get a ton of guidance in terms of how to conduct the interview and every one always goes a little differently, so if this interview felt different than your other ones, it’s probably just because that is how this particular interviewer does things. 

I will also say that when I was a high school student, I had a great Harvard interview. Got a call the night before, interviewer said the deadline was that week and he’d been told to do whatever it took to make sure I got interviewed before that deadline so he was coming to my high school to meet me. Interview went really well and he seemed to think I had a strong chance. I didn’t have an interview with Dartmouth.

104,Dartmouth Interview GONE WRONG?!,2,avxdzb,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/avxdzb/dartmouth_interview_gone_wrong/,"Okay so we know from the Harvard documents that getting an interview late from Harvard is a very good sign.

So maybe that's true of Dartmouth too?

Or maybe it's not. Dartmouth is a lot more generous with interviews then most other schools so maybe getting one even this late is meaningless. Maybe your alumni just forgot today contact you. It certainly sounds like you interviewer was busy and (maybe) a little disorganized. Maybe you are a ""throw them a bone"" candidate like you said.

Point is, nobody really knows and everybody (except for like a former AO or something) is just as clueless as you. Interviews are assigned late for a myriad of reasons and it's impossible to pinpoint a signal in all the noise.

That being said, I haven't heard of many Dartmouth applicants getting a phone call, and it sounds like even though there were no alumni in the area admissions made a very intentional effort to hook you up with one. That in conjunction with the fact that your interview was so late could mean that the admissions office needed to hear what an interviewer had to say about you (which would be a good sign). But also Dartmouth is known to place little value on alumni interviews so it seems strange that one would be so important to making their decision.  Who knows what they're thinking?

You also mentioned that your interviewer had to leave the interview because they were busy and that they arrived late. This means that you were not interviewing at an optimal time for them, which likely means that they needed to scramble to find snippet of time to interview you ASAP. I don't know exactly how you guys set up a time, but if you interviewer recommended this specific time it could mean a couple of things, 

1. You could have been assigned as a high priority interviewee. We saw on the Harvard documents that they assign each interviewee  on a scale of 1-5 (I think it's 5? Whatever it doesn't matter). For interviewees assigned a 1 they specifically say that they need the applicant interviewed ASAP. Perhaps Dartmouth has a similar ranking system and perhaps you were assigned a 1?

Or 2. The rushed interview just means that the interview report deadline is coming up and you interviewer has been procrastinating interviewing you. They just needed to scramble to get your report in before the general deadline. Based on what you the impression I have of your interviewer from your post this seems pretty likely.

TLDR - Who knows what it means? It might be good, it might be bad, it might be meaningless.

I hope this post was (semi) coherant. I'm a fellow Dartmouth applicant as well. Maybe if all goes well I'll see you campus next year :) Good luck!

Edit: Oh also write them a thank you note ASAP! Mentioning any information you forgot to tell them is great, as is reiterating that Dartmouth is your first choice (as long as you backed that up by knowing a lot about the school). Bonus points if you can mention something from your conversation!

107,HS Senior has Questions!,2,73xw0a,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/73xw0a/hs_senior_has_questions/,"Created a throwaway because I don't want to link my main account to my school. I'm a 19 (Junior) at Dartmouth. Also, I know that my positive experience does not speak for everyone here. Most people are very happy here, but a few are not, and I'm not trying to delegitimize their experiences. 

1) I turned down Penn, Georgetown, and UVA. I was denied at Harvard (after waitlist), Princeton, and Yale (to which I had applied EA and had been deferred). Choosing Dartmouth was the best decision of my life, and if I had to do things over I'd just apply ED here. I chose Dartmouth because of its small size and academic excellence, especially in undergraduate teaching. 


2) It's hard for me to remember what I was expecting when I decided to come here, but I'll try my best. I was surprised at how quickly this place felt like home for me. I was expecting the process to take a few terms, but I felt comfortable here within the first week. I was also surprised at how accessible the social life/greek life is here, given my impressions of other schools. I was also very surprised at the level of participation by the student body in school traditions - Homecoming, Green Key, various ""challenges"" (Ledyard, Lou's, etc.). I think the thing that surprised me most is the institutional memory of the student body - I feel like I've heard more stories of legendary students from the past and history of the college than I might've at other places.

3) I think that Dartmouth is the best place to go to college in the country, based off of my conversations with friends at other places and my own experience here. The best thing about Dartmouth is the social scene. Greek life is extraordinarily open and there is basically universal access to parties among the student body. In addition, the clubs and student interest groups have a strong focus on providing social outlets (formals, semis, socials) for their members. As a freshman, you have a number of opportunities to get to know people outside of your floor, and I was friends with a number of upperclassmen by the end of my first term. Academically, I am a huge fan of the quarter system. Classes are intense, but you do not have to focus on too many things at one time and it makes things easier to manage. You also have huge opportunities to meet and become friendly with professors. I have never been taught by a TA or grad student, and I have done research with or work for two professors here - the experience has been absolutely invaluable to me.


I'd like to talk about the frats for a little bit, since I know that's the huge elephant in the room. I am a huge fan of Greek Life, though it's not without its problems. Some frats, for instance, have problems with sexual assault. Like all things, though, this varies greatly among the frats - others are known for being safe or welcoming or tolerant etc. I think Greek Life is so great here in part because it is so pervasive. At some schools, there is simply not enough space for the majority of students to be in greek life, and so frats become exclusive and barriers to entry. At Dartmouth, most students are involved in Greek life in some way, and among those who are not many are not involved by their own choice (although this is not always the case - especially not for women, the sorority system has its own problems). Each house has a specific identity. For some houses (maybe 3 or so out of 13), this identity is entirely or almost entirely based on the varsity teams from which they draw new members. For the others, the identity is self-selecting and persistent - students have a year to figure out where they are comfortable, and generally join frats where they fit in. There are eclectic frats, co-ed houses, ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" frats, ""smart"" frats, etc. It's impossible to talk about this without descending into stereotypes, but my point is that there is enough of a diversity that most people actually find a frat that feels like home, and that in principle there is a home for almost everyone on campus, including natural introverts. The other cool thing is that most houses, including the ones which are not typically seen as the best on campus, have at least one major event which a ton of people on campus go to, so there is a flexible distribution of social events among the houses. And just about every house has the resources to plan and conduct social events and to have an open basement most nights. Frats and sororities also typically host A Cappella, dance, rap, and comedy performances every term. 


Most of my unaffiliated friends have found great communities in other student groups, and still make use of the frats as social spaces during on nights. I am affiliated, and it has been a extraordinary experience.


4) The food is good. Foco, which is the all-you-can-eat food court, has typically great food, although it varies and there are some bad days. The Hop just changed for the worse, but the food is still good. I don't do Collis that much, but it's also a popular option. The only negative about eating here is not the quality of the food itself, but the fact that the meal plans are pretty limiting and there are less dining options than at other, larger schools. Off-campus dining is much better than you'd expect from a school this size, though, so that's a plus. Generally multiple great options for eating out, whether you're looking for something quick or a fancier sit down dinner. 


5) You'll be fine. A bunch of friends of mine are Econ majors, and they're doing just fine without holing up and working 24/7. 


6) Students work out here more often than at other places, in my judgment, but generally I'd say the biggest problem is that students (including myself) live unhealthy lifestyles. Lots of drinking and a good amount of all-nighters. The work-hard play-hard lifestyle is definitely what prevails here. I love it, but you might not. Like at every college, there are problems with sexual assault/violence. Recent reforms have helped this, but it's never going away. Political conflict on campus used to be a problem, along with the sense among the frats that they were under the gun, but it has been an extraordinarily calm year - I'm not sure if this is a problem any more. Things seem to have really quieted down since the Lohse/Freedom Budget days, and the detente has allowed student life to thrive. 


7) Don't know enough about Williams or Northwestern to make the comparison. 


8) A lot of people will tell you that dating is dead here but that's not really true. Some students participate in ""hook-up culture"" - going to frat parties looking for a one-night partner, others find more permanent relationships. Dartmouth is a very social place, and the dating scene is what you make of it. 


9) They're great. Most of Dartmouth's parties are open to all students on campus, and the on nights are Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday to a lesser degree. Frats will typically be open to all of campus if they are open on a night, and they will typically be open WFS except if there is an event - formal, semi, etc. There are also big parties every term which are special, but are also open to all students. Pop-punk, Pigstick, highlighter, etc occur semi regularly. There is also one big weekend every term - in order, Homecoming, Winter Carnival, and Green Key. These also feature big parties open to all students. Parties typically center on frat basements, where students play Dartmouth pong. Dartmouth pong is a competitive drinking game with 2-4 (typically 4) players. Players use ping-pong paddles with the handles broken off (grasping around the paddle itself) and play what looks like a game of ping-pong with two clusters of cups of beer or water arranged on each side. If one person hits a cup on the opposite side, the other team drinks a half; if one person sinks a cup on the opposite side, the other team drinks a full. It's very fun, and a frat basement on a typical on night has 3-5 pong tables with games ongoing, music playing over speakers, and other students drinking and talking around the ongoing games waiting their turn. There are a lot more rules of pong and permutations of the game but it's too much to describe in text.


10) Housing options are pretty limited as a freshman, and you will almost certainly (or certainly, not sure which) have one or two roommates. I loved my roommates, and am still friends with both. As you become an upperclassman, you will be able to live in a single or in a fraternity (or both). Most students live on campus. ",11,"Greetings!

111,Unpopular opinion: time to grow up,0,j6tbu6,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/j6tbu6/unpopular_opinion_time_to_grow_up/,"if I may, I believe what OP is trying to convey, albeit a bit harshly for the populace of reddit to be receptive, is that there is likely a line to be drawn between being genuinely mentally unstable vs being appropriately stressed. To be clear, there is likely a moment where pulling yourself up by your bootstraps is the appropriate response to feeling bad as opposed to slipping into a mindset of victimhood. 

I do think there is validity in the assertion that entitlement is a bit pervasive in our undergraduate community. Additionally, it's not like that doesn't make any sense. The vast majority of people complaining here have not ever been responsible for anything outside of them selves with already very limited life experience (HS -> college). I'm not sure that we could really take everything everybody says in truly good faith as a result; How can you know your limits if you've not even experienced them yourself? Are your perceived limits your true limits?

I do think there is a time and a place to pull back and not allow yourself to really be drawn into the oh-so-attractive mindset that one cannot or should not be at fault. Abandoning, even slightly, responsibility for ones actions is a weakness if done disingenuously.
 
So yes, people do struggle with mental health issues. Some people are genuinely treated unfairly. Is that the majority? Goodness, I wouldn't bet a cent on that. Thus it follows that we should fairly consider the idea that we are in a rigorous educational environment designed to apply x amount of stress equally with ideas like ""this is unfair"" or ""i cant handle it"". Giving yourself reasons to fail or better cope with potential failure isn't exactly a recipe for success. 

Additionally, im not sure how applicable ""ultra capitalistic"" is to this particular issue. Principally, in academia, we should live in a meritocracy. Those who are able to rise to the occasion, separate themselves as the ""elite of the elite"" (I.E, above average amongst Cornell students) will be the ones to flourish. Or do you think your A is equal to somebody else's C? I don't think it is too intuitive to assert that this will lead to our demise... why even have a school like Cornell or Harvard or Yale if that is the case? Moreover, how have these schools been so dominant academically if it is in fact negative? Or shall i wait for the prophesized demise and take that as gospel?

112,Questions about Penn? Ask here!,34,i9xqdv,UPenn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/i9xqdv/questions_about_penn_ask_here/,"this is sort of funny ... know Brown kids ... they don't take a lot of P/f cause they know it won't be viewed so well to employers and grad schools... Penn generally has a more interdisciplinary mindset in general than many other schools .... and that is the focus of Ben F. scholars (who come from all four schools, not just CAS). The competitive atmosphere is prevalent at Penn for sure (and job seeking is a good thing by the way -- this is not just a recreational think tank endeavor) but it is also your mindset.  I had a roommate at Penn that never talked about grades and read a newspaper before every exam and just would not get sucked into it... and I know others that calculate their gpa after every homework assignment and try (usually unsuccessfully) to game the system. But there are plenty of people who seek collaboration and just want to learn and know if they study hard they will do just fine -- these are the chillest and the coolest and maybe it is you?  I think also that in some disciplines like comp. sci., your grades while important are not as important as what can you do, what have you coded, where are your capabilities.  For pre-med and pre-law you have a bit more pressure (not only at Penn but at ALL schools) to do well not only in your GPA but on the MCAT or LSAT so you have that pressure.  And, every IVY other than Yale, Harvard and Princeton, has that element of ""we try harder""... but at some point, it kicks in...  just learn, be diligent and you will do fine... Penn's statistics on future outcomes is super impressive. One thing that I hope Penn will remedy is that the One University policy allows all students to take classes at all other schools/colleges but you can't really major in a wharton discipline without applying to and getting accepted there... though you can take courses (and you can major in Economics in CAS etc...and computer science in both SEAS and CAS (I think).

127,Why is Brown CS salary after graduation so high?,42,hzj8u6,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/hzj8u6/why_is_brown_cs_salary_after_graduation_so_high/,"The data comes from [here, at the US Dept of Education.](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?217156-Brown-University) The definition is:

>The median annual earnings of former students  one year after graduation. **Only data from students who received federal  financial aid is included in the calculation.**  
>  
>These data are  based on school-reported information about students' program of  completion. The U.S. Department of Education Department cannot fully  confirm the completeness of these reported data for this school.

I think in other discussions, people have pointed out that the discrepancy with other top schools might have more to do with how many people are getting federal financial aid.  So it might have more to do with the sample or the sample size than actual, across-the-board earnings.

Here's a quote from [a discussion on this topic](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/2164299-colleges-with-highest-new-grad-median-earnings-by-major.html) at College Confidential:

>What is missing is the number graduating. According to Brown, in 2018  they awarded 248 BSs in CS. Since it started from 48 in 2010, we can  figure that there are no more than 800 CS graduates of Brown who are  more than a year after graduation. ABout 17% of Brown students are on  Pell grants. However, in 2012 it was 14%, and in 2008, it was 12%. So  perhaps 15% of all Brown CS graduates received federal support. So that  median represents maybe 120 students, and, considering the rate of  response to these questionnaires, we're talking MAYBE 50 graduates, more  likely closer to 30. So that median is meaningless.

The discussion quoted above also states that numbers from other universities like UPenn and Harvard are similarly too low to be representative.

Here's [another site](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/) with a lot of information about salaries. It  has Brown's median starting salary for CS as $84,600.

I'm no expert, but these are things I've seen in other Reddit posts or web searches that seem to confirm my suspicion that most Brown CS graduates won't be starting with $141K salaries.",13,"The U.S. Department of Education shows that one year after graduation, Brown CS bachelor's degree graduates have a median salary of $141,100.

Given my stats, I could have gotten in to Princeton ED if I'd applied, which would have qualified me for international financial aid. Alas, I set my sights too high and wasted the ED opportunity on Harvard EA.

Financially worth it? In terms of my salary, in general, no. I am making okay(upper middle-class) money, but if I'd financed my own education without my parents' help, I would have struggled.  Ivy League is not a surefire ticket to Wall Street or riches. Well actually I *can* get a job at a bulge bracket firm though if I tried, just not physically on Wall Street. Why I didn't is another story. I'm pretty well-off now but not because of my job.

Looking back though, the open curriculum was a unique experience and given you strive to gain in-depth knowledge in your field later, you will find that you have something special that no other university can provide you. It also means though that if you don't specialize properly it can have *bad* consequences. And do realize that Miklejohn advising is generally superficial(sorry, Brown).

Then again, not in terms of labor income, but in terms of wealth, *yes*, it was financially worth it, because open questioning led to my making some pretty unconventional decisions, and becoming pretty wealthy for my age. If I'd gone to Princeton I might have a marginally better job, but not the wealth I have now. I'm well-off now because of that unconventional view on things, only sustained by that open exploration of knowledge and quenching of curiosity. I'm worth more than all of my friends who went to Harvard/Stanford Law School after college x(be it Brown, Yale, whatever).

Also, going through the open curriculum, you can later realize that your whole K-12 education did *not* set you up for what you really want to do in life. I'm a more MIT/Caltech guy I realize now. Shocking but true. One professor at Brown I remember told me that she had the same experience - got bad grades in her intro subject but is now teaching that subject...

But then my K-12 was generally of subpar quality, having come from a developing country...",14,"Just curious if yall felt that the Brown experience/degree was worth it financially in the end. Alumni and current student feel free to answer!

By this same logic, doesn't it follow that the schools could decide to pay their faculty (or other employees) less, because the online teaching experience doesn't provide as much value as in-person? Obviously that would be cruel.

Obv a super rich school with a huge endowment like Harvard is going to be fine regardless, but in general, I hope that universities will continue to pay their employees, and in order to do that, many of them probably need to maintain their income from tuition. Plus, endowments are often restricted. Or is that not the case? I'd be curious to see the operating costs & budgets for some different private universities. 

Maybe a more nuanced approach is that universities should offer to re-evaluate all financial aid claims and eligibilities (like immediately, rather than at the beginning of the next academic year), given that many families have experienced major financial upsets that might make them eligible for more need-based aid.

If grad school is on your radar, Brown students place VERY frequently into top grad schools. I don't know about med school data, but I know that [Brown students who go to law school more frequently end up at Harvard than anywhere else](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/law-school/statistics).

Brown has a very different culture from Harvard. I think almost everyone I know would agree that it is very collaborative and not at all competitive, which is not the case at Harvard.

143,Dean Zia's Decision on Universal Pass,33,frzyvg,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/frzyvg/dean_zias_decision_on_universal_pass/,"consider 2 premed students, one has a stable home life and one doesn't. if the university makes it mandatory S/NC for this semester then both students can argue it was forced by the university and the med schools will likely accept the credit because many people will be in this situation (You really think a med school will deny applicants from Yale and Harvard which have implemented mandatory S/NC?). However if Brown doesn't do this then the person without a stable home life will be more likely to have to change their course to S/NC meaning they won't get into a med school",28,"Dear Students, 

I hope that you and your loved ones are well, and that you have been able to reconnect with your classmates and instructors today. Our primary goal in the coming weeks is to continue to support all students, including those most directly impacted by this crisis, with individualized (academic, financial, and personal) advising as well as systematic support. 

I am writing to address student concerns about Brown’s decision on how to handle grading this semester. Consistent with Brown’s student-centered approach to education, we believe it is important to empower students to make educational choices for themselves, even when these choices are difficult. After widespread consultation with faculty and students, we adopted a policy that lets students revisit decisions to take courses S/NC up until April 17th. In addition, faculty may request that their course(s) be converted to mandatory S/NC. 

In the past week, I have received numerous emails from students who would prefer a “universal pass” system, where everyone automatically receives a passing grade, arguing that this is the most equitable approach in the current circumstances. I have also heard from many students from a broad range of backgrounds who have argued that the most equitable approach is for students to retain the agency to choose a letter grade or S/NC for each course.

The communications that I have found the most compelling have come from students who have overcome challenges after struggling academically during their first years at Brown, and whose grades this term would document their success. For these students, letter grades this semester – even if only in one class – could showcase their resilience in the face of adversity, and help them secure access to future opportunities. The hopes and concerns that these students have shared are very real, and they speak directly to how education can transform our lives and those of our communities. For these reasons, we have decided against a “universal pass” or mandatory S/NC system.
 
I am thankful that – at this moment of uncertainty – equity and inclusion remain at the forefront of all our discussions, even if we may disagree on the right approach. My commitment in the days and weeks ahead is to ensure that you and your peers have the best support possible to make the best decisions for yourselves. Please reach out to college@brown.edu if you need support with this or other decisions.

I wish you all the best this week in reconnecting as a remote learning community, a community committed to creating, sharing, and applying knowledge in support of improving the world. 

Sincerely, 

Rashid Zia
Dean of the College",1585633492
144,Brown v. MIT??,11,frcs25,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/frcs25/brown_v_mit/,"One thing to consider is, Brown is very undergrad focused. At Brown, undergrads are little over 2x the size of grad population. At MIT, grad population is little over 1.5x undergrad population. What this means is that professors at Brown often have very small research groups (like 1~5 PhD students per professor) so finding research groups is very easy and you get a lot of individual attention from professors. Some of the professors I met at Brown have become my strongest advocates and I will eternally be grateful to them. I'm now heading to Stanford for PhD where grad students are little over 1.4x undergrad population. I'm personally very satisfied with this trajectory because I get to go to undergrad focused school for undergrad and grad focused school for grad.

As for friends, I made some of my closest friends while tackling psets together! In Brown's math program, you will also discover the joys of pset parties!! This was the case for me in my math and physics classes. Also, Brown's math department in particular, I would say, is pretty tight knit (check out Friday Math Tea sessions if you end up choosing Brown!). I made some really great friends through the math dept even though I'm physics.

Regarding academics, I think that Brown has quite strong pure math programs, although if you are looking to go more bio side, Brown has a fantastic Applied Math program! You can also venture into Biostatistics which is a separate program administered under the Masters in Public Health (but undergrads can take the courses. I myself took a statistical data analysis class in biostat program).

On a final note, I'm sure MIT students have great post-grad outcomes, but Brown students also end up in fantastic places! I didn't know many premed very well personally, but the three that I know ended up in Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and UChicago med schools. I know far more people who went to other grad schools, and the vast majority ended up in top 10 institutions (I can remember 1 Harvard Law, most common destinations from physics seemed like Stanford/Harvard/MIT, chemistry ended up in Caltech/Harvard, Princeton seemed to be a popular destination for CS PhDs, idk the rest), so I don't think you need to worry about how strong your research profile will become at Brown as opposed to MIT!",26,"Hi, I'm a '24 choosing between the two schools in title. I am a super indecisive person and literally (literally!) have no idea which one I prefer. Thoughts? 

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements. 

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there. I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

146,Am I an idiot for wanting to transfer to Brown?,24,fnxwu4,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fnxwu4/am_i_an_idiot_for_wanting_to_transfer_to_brown/,"Are you an idiot?  Not at all.  I’m in my 30s and to this day still have what if regrets about Harvard so I completely understand really wanting to push for a transfer to Brown if that’s where you truly want to go.

But that all said, I do think I agree with your parents on this.  The fundamental purpose of going to college is to get an education.  It sounds from your post like this is already happening at your current school and that you are in fact bonding with your instructors who are all willing to spend extra time to invest in you.  You’ll certainly find that at Brown too if you reach out.  But is it really worth going back to square one at this point?

Also, and this is extremely important for you to understand, there are a LOT of stupid students at Brown.  I only have the assessment you provided in your initial posting but if that’s all 100% true, you’ll likely still be on the higher end of your classes at Brown also.  You’ll certainly not be put on a pedestal by students at Brown because many of them have pretty big egos (having themselves been among the best students in their respective classes most of their lives) so that will at least be taken care of I guess, but on the flip side of everyone has that kind of attitude it becomes much harder to get legitimate recognition for achievements.  So keep that in mind.

Now this is not to say Brown is horrible.  Far from it, there are a lot of great people that go to school there and a lot of great professors (some of whom I still keep in touch with).  But you need to understand that Brown isn’t this magical world where everyone eats sunshine and shits rainbows.  It’s a school with its own culture, and it’s own strengths and weaknesses.  You need to take a good hard look at what those strengths and weaknesses are relative to the strengths and weaknesses of your current school, and really see if making the transition is worth all the costs.",21,"I'm currently a student at a mid-tier school. I have a 4.0 GPA, a great research position with a PI that's genuinely invested in my career, my professors and advisers all know me by name and have vowed to help me get into a great medical school and I have lots of friends that genuinely care about me. Perhaps most importantly, I will be graduating in 1.5 years with no debt.

But I'm still applying to transfer to Brown. I don't like being put on a pedestal by my peers and professors. I want to be surrounded by people that I know are smarter than me, more motivated than me, and will push me out of my comfort zone. I want to take art classes at RISD and do research in Public Policy while I'm getting my Biology degree. I want to fully explore my creative side before I start medical school. 

I put hours upon hours into my application getting my story on paper, editing my essays and filming my Video Portfolio. I know that I very likely won't get in, but I'm safe in the knowledge that I genuinely put my all into my application.

However, my parents, my professors and my advisers don't understand why I'm so invested in transferring. My parents aren't very supportive of this goal, because they're looking at the big picture (i.e. my attending medical school), which I understand completely; the logical thing to do would be to want to remain at my current school.

As students at Brown, do you guys think I'm putting the school on a pedestal? What would you do in my position?",1585048633

Then all the facilities members get sick as we shut down because nobody shows up to their dining hall and janitorial shifts.

I'm sorry Brown's response wasn't IDEAL, but students on financial aid got $150 for the trouble (I know Harvard kids got $500, just look at their endowment, maybe u shld have went to Harvard... oh wait) , classes were cancelled BEFORE a massive outbreak, students were able to return home BEFORE a Providence quarantine. AND the kids whose homes are in hot zones get to stay on campus AND the kids with severe financial burden get to stay on campus.

The cost of a pandemic is not Brown's fault, it's just fun for y'all to bandwagon and hate on CPAX and Brown because you're ungrateful.

My CS friends ended up in Princeton, Berkeley, and UPenn, some in ML/AI which I heard is insanely competitive, and those who didn't go to grad school ended up in Google, FB, and Microsoft. I don't know any one who went the business route (mainly because a majority of my friends were all STEM). From my experience of grad apps, LORs can really make or break your application, and students I know were able to form very close working relationships with their research advisors (i.e. spectacular LORs)",2,"Hi!

How's the graduate placement here? I know it's different case-per-case, but I'm wondering if it's not super out of reach to place into top grad programs around the US (say, prestigious CS programs or business schools.)

I eventually decided to go to college (probably for the best), but my choice was, well, maybe not the best. I felt that if I didn't go to Columbia I would have the most regret since it's just so well known, but I'm starting to feel the opposite way. So what if Columbia has 4 more living billionaires? Who am I kidding? These aren't factors that are going to seriously affect my undergraduate experience. I would love to chat -- I am curious about your decision making process and life at Brown. At the end of the day, I could've made a million charts, diagrams, and comparisons, but I knew deep down that I was probably going to go to Columbia -- I guess some mistakes you just have to make yourself.",13,"Got in as a Freshman.

Chose Columbia because my enlightened decision making process was ""hurr us news"". 

There's literally no CS community there. There's not even a single coding club... yes, *not even a single one*. ""But isn't there at least -?"" NOPE. Nothing. Unless your idea of coding is Goldman Sachs Investment Banking internships.

So, my first question would be -- does Brown have a good number of coding clubs?

Second question is more subjective but yikes, I don't really enjoy the ""vibe"" at Columbia. The classes are a constant beat down -- tests frequently average in the 50s -- and nothing matters because it's all curved to a B- at the end of the semester anyway. Oh, and I haven't taken a single class I care about yet because... what's an 18-year-old's self-discovery process without a bit of oppressive core curriculum and a side of 400 page rants about the corn harvest in 1582.

My biggest issue though is the community here. There is no community. I don't enjoy the nonexistent personal space, the lack of nature, and the isolation fueled by the insane workload and NYC in general. When I visited Brown, I got this sense of an awesome community where it's really easy to make friends and have fun (perhaps I am naive in that sense? Would anyone care to disillusion me?) 

I guess where I am right now is that Columbia is kind of miserable and I don't think it's worth it. Could I survive 4 more years? Probably.

But in terms of prestige and international name recognition/ reputation/fame HYPS are supreme.  Think about how many Nobel Laureates we have compared to those schools. Think about how many billionaire alumni we have compared to those schools. Why do our youtubers (as much as I love them) say Ivy League admissions reaction or a day in the life of an Ivy League student? Why can’t they all just say Brown? We are inferior in the typical “prestige” metrics which lends us our #57 global ranking (inaccurate imo). Also even look at what happens to cross admits with HYPS. They overwhelmingly choose those schools. That doesn’t imply they offer better educational experiences though. I personally think Brown offers one of the best if not the best educational experience of any university. However, I think it’s just a pure falsehood to say we’re remotely close to HYPS in terms of prestige. For example, every time I say I go to Brown, ppl always ask why Brown instead of HYPS... No one asks, why Harvard to Harvard kids. I’m not trying to hate on Brown because I love it. However, I’m just trying to share my honest opinion about our standing when it comes to prestige.

They initially gave me a not so good offer, but then I appealed and got a much better deal. At Brown, it is harder to get in as an international student needing financial aid given that it isn't a need-blind school for international students so they DO consider your ability to pay in the admissions process (how much harder may be negligible though given how hard it is to get in at all). The consequence being a lot of international students are very very wealthy...However, if you do get admitted they try to do their best to give you an offer based on what your family can pay...to varying degrees of success. A good friend of mine applied and got in, but they didn't give her enough aid despite many appeals, calls to the FA office etc. But several other people I know personally got in needing aid and were fine (full scholarships). 

In any case, at any US schools you don't find a lot of international students on full aid anyways (hence the stereotype that int'l students are filthy rich), even schools that are need-blind for internationals like Harvard and Yale. But with such elite schools, their aid offers are more generous and the FA office gives more support than what I have heard about other schools.",14,"Hello, I'm a senior hoping to apply to Brown ED this fall.

164,Can premed students share experiences with advising?,7,bhuhlt,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/bhuhlt/can_premed_students_share_experiences_with/,"You can find the number of applicants from Brown at [https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/](https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/).  At least for the last 3 years I have been monitoring the number, the number of applicants from Brown remains pretty stable. This application cycle there are 235 applicants from Brown. Pre-health advising knows the qualifications needed to be admitted to med schools. Only qualified applicants get a committee letter. The article you linked basically tells you for those who are not qualified, they won't get it. There is no structural flaw.  All the schools at this level have committee letter system. If Brown has ""structural flaws"" in pre-health advising, all the schools at this level have the same structural flaws. This system benefits the applicants who have the committee letter, which shows institutional support. Two third of applicants from Ivies have at least one gap year. Gap year is not needed if you are a very strong applicant. Last year one person I know got into Harvard Medical School with no gap year. Again, they will advise you if you are a strong applicant or not. In my opinion, PLME program is good for us because PLMEs are not applying out. Brown's life sciences programs are extremely strong. More than one fifth of students are in life and medical sciences. ([https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/degrees-and-completions](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/degrees-and-completions))",2,"Hi everyone, Brown is one of my top choices for where I'll be attending college this fall.

However, I am a little concerned about the pre-health advising, based largely off of this article from a couple years ago:  [http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/28/applicants-struggle-structural-flaws-pre-health-advising-system/](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/28/applicants-struggle-structural-flaws-pre-health-advising-system/) and what I've been able to find online seems to have confirmed this.

I would appreciate it if students with experience with the pre-health advising could share their thoughts, if it's a significant disadvantage. I am also a bit confused (and concerned?) from what I've heard about the advisers strongly recommending people to take gap years before applying to medical school.

Finally, I also noticed that many of the premed students I've seen are part of the PLME program. Does the existence of this program put regular premed kids at a disadvantage/as a second priority?

170,Is it possible to get an A in UW,10,jc0g2c,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/jc0g2c/is_it_possible_to_get_an_a_in_uw/,"I got an A in UW in essays. 

Here’s how it broke down: 

P1: B+
P2: A
P3: A
P4: A 

I’m a transfer student so UW was like the nth expository writing class I’ve taken in three years (other university had similar required course). I’m going to go out on a limb and offer some sincere, unsolicited advice for UW, based on surviving the inanity of like 11 credit hours in college writing courses. 

Use the resources available to you— office hours (as everyone else has said), argument coaching, writing center for feedback. Talk to librarians when you’re doing research!

Don’t get distracted by the topic/material; write to the assignment. It’s not really about what you’re writing on but *how* you’re writing it: pay attention to the prompts and see if you can make a “checklist” of things expected in the essay. Usually it’s about initiating a “conversation” with (an)other author(s) in your writing. 
Stick to the conventions of the writing style at hand. 

That being said, if you have some freedom in picking your topic, pick something exciting/fun for you, because you’ll enjoy writing more. Don’t pick a topic just because it seems impressive or current. For both P2 and P3 I scrapped about a week of work each because I realized I was kind of forcing a topic I wasn’t actually enthusiastic about. 

Strongly edit for transitions. Writing professors love clean transitions between paragraphs and concepts. If you took out the rest of the paper, and just had the first and last sentences of your paragraphs or sections, would the reader still have a loose idea of what you were arguing? If not, revise. 

For the research paper (and maybe P2) if you’re writing on a certain discipline or field, research the conventions for writing in that discipline. I.e. if it’s a sociology paper, google “conventions for writing in sociology” and see what you find. It helps you write with more authority.

Don’t just use Columbia’s writing resources. Harvard and Purdue are two other schools with excellent writing programs and there’s a wealth of information and approaches out there. I’ve also found great writing resources from Bowdoin online too. While Columbia wants you to think its approach is unique and scary, it really isn’t. Good academic writing is good academic writing, period. 

Edit, edit, edit. Then edit more. Your goal in UW is clarity and concision, always. Save the empty rhetorical flourishes for when you’re trying to impress a tenured philosophy professor and/or your next tinder match. 🤷

Also just don’t get discouraged. It’s a cliche but ~~~ writing is a process ~~~ lol. You’re making a good investment in your future by practicing writing well. Plus, as people have mentioned, they love dunking on the first progression and then ease up after that. I think it’s stupid and discouraging, but so are many facets of higher education, so c’est la vie. 

Hope this helps.

Edit: To answer your question about comparison to other top schools - I can't speak authoritatively on this because I haven't gone to them, but the impression I get is that the three most stressful schools are Columbia, Chicago, and MIT. Caltech has harder work but also is quite small and has a much closer-knit community than we do. From people who have gone there I get the sense that Harvard can be very stressful because of the environment but they grade very nicely so on an academic level it doesn't feel like a literal daily struggle for survival like it does here. Same for most of the other top schools, which generally have laxer (in most cases much laxer) requirements and easier grading than we do.

I am a SPS student. Many of you probably know me as the fervent SPS defender. I love my school and I am very proud of it. I know some posts that I made were very controversial to say the least and probably offended many people. My aggressive comments and posts were in large part a frustrated response to the pervasive hate against master's students, and SPS students in general in this community. I know most of you probably don't think this way and have respect to everyone that even made it here at Columbia. I let my anger to the few get the best of me. I overreacted and pissed off lots of people. I want to apologize for that. 

In the meantime though, I hope for your understanding, and your help. SPS is a new thriving school at Columbia that is striving to establish itself among the other famous Columbia brands. The school, the administration, and the students are all trying hard to show the Columbia level of excellence. I think you all can relate to the anger and frustration if you could just picture that something you and your community have put in so much time, effort, and love into gets trashed by others. I actually think attacking SPS online wasn't that big of deal. People are entitled to their own opinions. But the last straw was when some troll added a controversy section to SPS's wiki page. This triggered me because now I know there will be real life consequences to students who go to the school and will be looking for jobs. Even for those of you who hate SPS and consider us as a revenue source, please consider this: if SPS is a cash cow like you say, what would happen to Columbia financially if people stop going to SPS for its bad rep. Columbia will drop in rankings and you will all be impacted. It's honestly going to be a lose-lose situation for everybody.

So, I am really hoping someone could help me delete the controversy section off. Please, if not for SPS, for yourself.

Also I have to admit it, he's a pretty good one.

The real dead giveaway is this comment-

 

First I want to thank you for stepping up and saying such nice things about SPS. I personally have never heard of such an acronym ""CYH"", but it is nice to know that it is a thing. We are significantly younger compared to the other two schools but as you said, our academic horsepower is unmatched. Though objectively I have to say Yale Law and Harvard Med are probably more famous than us currently, but we have every hope to surpass them in that regard as well in the near future.

I am sorry for your rejection. I know it must hurt. But what's important is to understand why you got rejected, and learn from it. At SPS, a considerable part the admission decisions, decisive even, is your softs. The admission process at SPS is not nearly as straightforward as for law school where scores always come first. These softs include your extracurricular activities, your work experience, your intangibles, and many other factors beyond your control. Having perfect GPAs and GREs alone won't make the cut. Rather, it's only a necessity. Maybe it was the fact that you turned down invitations to social gatherings that later became the kryptonite to your application, because leadership skills and the ability to interact with all walks of life are highly emphasized in SPS's admission decisions. Without those, chances are you are in for becoming part of the larger denominator of the admissions rate. So, even though it was not the best outcome you hoped for, you could still learn a lot from it. At the end of the day, it is not where you go to school that matters the most, it's where you can find the best match. Maybe SPS is just not a good match for you. Our students are not necessarily smarter or more accomplished than other schools. We also have tons of stress, pressure and hate (as you can obviously see from the posts here) to deal with. The fact that Yale Law took you means that they found you to be a good match, and that is where you can get the most out the school to unleash all your potential. Good luck!",23,"**tl:dr theres a crazy guy on this subreddit spreading hate. Please stop replying to him in any form. Yeah it was funny but hes not worth it. hopefully mods ban this guy. Please dont reply to his future posts.**

&#x200B;

I don't know about other people, but I've had enough of this dude and his insecure whining. The terrifying thing is when you read all the posts and comments together I think he's dead serious and extremely insecure. He unleashed a torrent of discord between all these people and it's never going to stop unless we ban him ASAP.

It's all fun stuff, but at this point this dude's insecurity and tier lists are so stupid and only serve to sow division between the schools. He's literally trying to make the schools hate each other by pretending to be a law student. At one point he literally compared SPS hatred to racism in America. Who the hell does this?

To the people who have fun with this guy: Yes, he is indeed hilariously stupid, but it's not worth it to let someone like this have a voice. **I worry this guy makes SPS students feel attacked who just want to be in peace and have an education. To these SPS students, please know I personally do not look down on any of you for going to SPS. I honestly think the hatred towards the school is mostly focused at this guy and others trying to talk shit, but there are dicks out there who will be shitty to people based on their school. Not everyone will be like this I promise.**

SPS dude I know you are going to reply to this as the other CLS account saying ""What i'm not that Icy guy and fuck you for saying he should be banned for speaking the truth"", but please know you are probably going to reinforce a belief that you should be banned. You are objectively mentally ill. Please go to a mental health professional tell them all the stuff you said here on this reddit and expect the words to be hard to hear. I'm very serious. I don't pity narcissists like you in the slightest, but for everyone else's sake just get some help. You are a sad person with the mindset of a high school student raging at a video game they lost.

Everyone knows he's going to come on here again and the sad truth is he will actually try to actively dissuade impressionable people into avoiding other schools and hurting their reputation with new accounts, but if he shows up again just call him out and warn people away from his post.

For anyone whos confused as fuck about what I'm talking about see all this bullshit here:

Last thing: It's perfectly okay to argue that your school may be treated unfairly and a lot of the people against SPS may want to ease up a little on some posts. Yeah I get you are speaking about the school and probably not the people, but maybe ease up anyway. But people...... don't act crazy if someone doubts a departments prestige, regardless of school (assuming they aren't an asshole). I feel like alot of people on this subreddit worry too much whether their school is considered to still be in the elite echelon of Columbia. Chill. Be objective. Don't be assholes (but maybe if the person you respond to is clearly an asshole feel free to throw a jab in lol). Have fun. Peace",1598941900
181,Tuition protest,63,ia91jj,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/ia91jj/tuition_protest/,"At least for SEAS, that is not true. We only get to take classes in summer if we stay below 40 credits overall, which means 2 credits less than in previous years. Also, the courses offered for juniors/seniors this summer are a joke, at least in the CS department. There’s barely anything offered at all, and personally it feels like Columbia is just using this make-believe summer as an excuse to not lower tuition like Princeton or Harvard did.",14,"After cancelling any in-person interaction for undergraduates, tuition was virtually unchanged (no 2% increase from last year). Why don’t people protest/have petitions to argue against the same tuition? I’ve seen a lot of petitions on other matters but not tuition. Is it beyond hope??

I think it’s super unreasonable on Columbia’s part to claim the online Columbia experience is at all comparable to the value in person.",1597533218
182,Japanese at Columbia?,16,i7f1m0,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/i7f1m0/japanese_at_columbia/,"I took Intensive Japanese at Harvard many years ago. It met twice as often as the regular Japanese course. It was my third language, after French and German. It is a fascinating but extremely difficult language for an English speaker. The structure of the language is different. The writing system is complex. There are no familiar words, not even ""faux amis,"" as in French. Spoken properly, Japanese is spoken very rapidly. One of the teachers used to beat the rhythm on the desk with a ruler. She knew that if we didn't get into the habit of speaking quickly we'd never be able to use our Japanese with native speakers.

If you have a reasonable knack for language, you can learn, but you have to keep up.

Columbia has had distinguished scholars of Japanese language and culture and it's a major university so I imagine it has excellent Japanese classes.",13,Need to choose a foreign language. Is Japanese really difficult? What are some of your experiences?,1597126691
183,Off-Campus Living Allowance,36,hx1nr9,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/hx1nr9/offcampus_living_allowance/,"Maybe I just haven't had the same experiences, because I had an incredibly difficult time getting an appeal two years in a row and getting transparent information from the department even before COVID. Perhaps most people aren't having these issues and that's great. But there aren't even enough work-study jobs normally for students who are eligible, so I can't imagine there will be enough for all the students who are remote. And hopefully, they will release another program like the summer grant for those who can't complete jobs, but there's no information on it yet. 

To me, the fact that some people fall through the cracks is the part that isn't good enough. We have so so much admin, but they can't think of what I don't think are crazy, albeit possibly outlier, scenarios when creating the plans and dispersing this information? Even if they didn't change anything but actually released info about the average success of appealing or talked about possible plans they were thinking about to help students be financially secure (like another grant to replace work for the school year), I likely wouldn't feel the same way. Harvard released their off-campus living amount when announcing the plans for the school year, and consistent information given on a reasonable timeline, in conjunction with academic decisions (because for me the two go together), without me having to constantly check websites and Reddit for updates since they don't email us these things, would just generally make the situation better even if the information didn't change.",16,"Turns out off-campus living allowance for CC/SEAS is only going to be 4,000.
